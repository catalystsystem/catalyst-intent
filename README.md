# LI.FI Intent based cross-chain swaps

LI.FI Intent is a cross-chain swap protocol built with the Open Intents Framework, OIF. It allows users to sign intents: What asset they want, how they want etc, etc. which is claimed and then delivered by solvers.

### Open Intents Framework

The OIF is a reference implementation of a modular and composable intent system. LI.FI intent is built as an implementation of it, meaning it is compatible and compliments any other OIF deployment.

## Integration

By integrating LI.FI intents, either as a solver or as an intent issuer, you will also be integrating with the OIF: https://docs.li.fi/lifi-intents/introduction.
